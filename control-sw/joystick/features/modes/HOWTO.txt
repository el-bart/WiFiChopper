mods
========
location to specify file names to be compiled during build. create file named
after build mode (default mode is 'default' - it must always exist) and insert
lines that specifies files that can be used. notice that it is highly
recomended to use wildcards here.

features
========
in order to create new feature place here file named after given feature(s)
(ex: 'qsort' and 'bublesort' for different sorting algorithm implementations)
and place paths to files that are to be compiled the same way as in modes.
