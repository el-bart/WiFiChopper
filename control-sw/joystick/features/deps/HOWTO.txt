files indicating dependencies can be present in direcotry. general rules are:
  - each file name represents profile-dependent elements. exception is 'common',
    which is taken as a part for all of the profiles.
  - {$profile|common} file lists components (one each line) that current one
    depends on. only components build by this build system are listed there!
  - {$profile|common}_dynamic_compile is executable and displays on the screen
    all flags that are to be taken for compilation of this component. common
    usage is adding runtime-dependent flags (ex.: 'echo -DMY_MACRO') and
    getting dependencies in runtime, by means of dpkg-config and simillar
    tools. in general you're free to do whatever you wan inside this script
    as long as output contains one line with compiler flags.
  - {$profile|common}_dynamic_link is the same as corresponding
    {$profile|common}_dynamic_compile file, except that it provides flags
    that are to be passed for linker. typical usage is adding extra link
    libraries (ex.: 'echo -lsome_external_library').
  - {$profile|common}_dynamic_compile_local are flags that are set only in
    given component, i.e. they are not passed as flags for components dependent
    on this one, as flags from other scripts does. this can be useful for
    setting up specific values, that should not be available for derived
    components, like configuration file name, for config component, which
    usually differ in relese (ex. 'some.conf') and (manual) test profiles
    (ex. 'testdata/some.conf').
