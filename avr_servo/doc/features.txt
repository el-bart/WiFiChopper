* operating up to 17 servos.
* persistent declaration of min/max positions servo cannot overcome.
* persistent declaration of default servos position.
* RS-232 communication over simple, text-based (i.e. readable) protocol, with hardware flow control.
* watchdog ensuring self-recovery after a failure.
* low power consumption.
* overcurrent fuse protection.
* less then 1.5 deg precision for typical servos.
* can go beyond min-max positions of RC mechanisms with longer/shorter impulses.
* operating at 0.5ms to 2.5ms time period, making it sutable for every RC servo available.
* RS-232 communication with 38400,8N1 speed/mode with RTS/CTS hardware flow.
* driver with non-blocking communication.
