this is set of team_tools for bzr VCS. to use it one must
copy example file (bzr_team.conf) to project root directory
(notice that this have to be file that is NOT under version
controll, to avoid collisions with other developers - do NOT
commit it!). from now on you can run rebase/deliver tools
from repository root directory.

NOTE: it is possible to create .bzrignore file in project's
root and add there bzr_team.conf file, so that it will not
be visible by Bazaar by default. this file can (and should)
be kept under version controll.
