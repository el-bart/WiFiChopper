motherboard: compiling
======================

this section describes how to (cross-)compile piece of code, that is to be run on the motherboard.
it is assumed 


on-host compilation
-------------------

compilation on local host machine is beneficial mostly for testing and development. if you just
want to run the system, skip this step.

to compile and run code on your local linux machine it just just enough to do:
cd uChaos/src && make <TARGET>
where <TARGET> can be: release, debug, test, mtest. it builds release version, debug version,
automated tests and manual tests, respectively.


cross-compilation
-----------------

in order to do this, one must download and install OpenWRT sources and add this package to the
build:

be sure to use gcc-4.7 or newer. this can be setup in "Advanced configuration options
(for developers)" -> "Toolchain Options" -> "GCC compiler Version" menu.
