OpenWRT config
--------------

after installing image of the system, and all of the required modules, it is time to configure
its network. proposed config is that router's WiFi will be access point, with dhcp (i.e. 'lan'),
while ethernet port will provide internet access, if connected (i.e. 'wan'). thanks to this one
can easily connect to chopper, the same way to any other AP, while (stationary) ethernet
connection allows easy packages and upgrades installations, using regular network connection and
opkg package manager.

first step to setup WiFi is to enable it via UCI:
uci set wireless.radio0.disabled=0
uci commit

next wireless network needs to be setup in the /etc/config/wireless file. example configuration
for WPA2/PSK encryption is here:

config wifi-device 'radio0'
        option type 'mac80211'
        option macaddr '14:e6:e4:e7:66:ac'
        option hwmode '11ng'
        option htmode 'HT20'
        list ht_capab 'SHORT-GI-20'
        list ht_capab 'SHORT-GI-40'
        list ht_capab 'RX-STBC1'
        list ht_capab 'DSSS_CCK-40'
        option disabled '0'
        option channel '2'

config wifi-iface
        option device 'radio0'
        option network 'lan'
        option mode 'ap'
        option ssid 'wifichopper'
        option encryption 'psk2'
        option key 'SomeSecretKeyToWiFi'



next step is network configuration. assuming WiFi will provide 192.168.1.x network
/etc/config/network file should be set to something similar to this:

config interface 'loopback'
        option ifname 'lo'
        option proto 'static'
        option ipaddr '127.0.0.1'
        option netmask '255.0.0.0'

config interface 'wan'
        option ifname 'eth0'
        #option type 'bridge'
        option proto 'dhcp'

config interface 'lan'
        option ifname  'wlan0'
        option type    'bridge'
        option proto   'static'
        option ipaddr  '192.158.1.1'
        option netmask '255.255.255.0'


having this done, reboot. you should be able to connect to the device via wireless connection.
while having ethernet cable plugged in, you can access internet as well.

in order to run motherboard's software you'll need following packages:
libmcrypt - provides encryption routines, used for network communication
librt     - provides timers support.
libstdcpp - C++ standard library. minimum working version is the one from gcc-4.7 package.
            note: this must be libstdcpp - uClibcxx will NOT work due to lack of C++11 support.
kmod-ftdi_serial - driver for the FTDI chip, responsible for RS-232 communication with RT-Board.
