mother board communication protocol
===================================

communication uses json parsed as tuples. each tupple starts with version number. in case of
error following tuple is sent:
(V, "ERROR", "<reason string>")
where V is version number. following commands are available:


1. greeting
command:
(V, "hello")
response:
(V, "uChaos awaits orders...", X, Y, Z)
where X, Y and Z are main, major and minor version numbers.


2. speed setting
command:
(V, "set speed", A, B, R)
where A and B are speed of main 1 and 2 engine, respectively and R is read engine speed (both +/-).
A and B are 0..255 values. R is -255..+255 value.
response:
(V, "ok")


3. read speed setting
command:
(V, "get speed")
response:
(V, A, B, R)
where A, B and R are the same as for speed setting.


4. read input voltage
command:
(V, "Vin")
response:
(V, A)
where A is voltage value, that has been read (in Volts).


5. disconnection
command:
(V, "bye")
response:
(V, "bye, bye!")


6. accelerometer reading
command:
(V, "accel")
response:
(V, X, Y, Z)
where X, Y and Z are accelerometer's reading for corresponding axis.
